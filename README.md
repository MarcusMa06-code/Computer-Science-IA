# Online Registration System

Developed by Marcus Maüê¥

## Introduction

This project was first inspired when my school decided to adopt to a "digital registration system" to track students' attendence rate.

But in fact, the "digital registration system" was an excel sheet and seemed a bit difficult to use.

Therefore, I decided to make a better registration system and automate the process as my IB Computer Science IA project.

The project involves technologies of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I didn't have much experiences on them and it took me 9 days to learn the basics by watching YouTube bootcamp videos in twice the speed. There are also other useful resources which will be listed shortly.

## Functionalities

1. Database: Students' Information is stored as a JSON file.
2. History Data: All the registration history is stored locally on users' devices and can be altered later on.
3. Analysis: Automatically calculate students' attendence rate.
4. Auto Complete: Auto complete detail information such as student ID and surname by referecing to the JSON file.
5. One Click And Register All: Another functionality enable by JSON. It helps to prevent repetation in entering information one by one.
6. Date Picker: Search specific data within a certain time span.
7. Grade Search: Search Students with their grades.
8. Export Table: Download excel sheel after clicking the button.

## A Few Words From the Developer

This is the first time ever for me to develop a working project. I am really grateful to the contributors of the open source community and whoever sharing their knowledge for the greater good.

So far, I am not sure whether I can make this repository open source because I havn't complete my IB diploma. But I sure will open source the code soon or later.

## Useful Resources

During the development, there are plenty of resources that help me confront with any difficulties. What an amazing era we are living in!
